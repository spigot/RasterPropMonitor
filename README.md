# RasterPropMonitor

Plugin for Kerbal Space Program enabling creation of advanced display monitors and other useful and informative props for internal capsule view.

See [the forum support thread](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57603) for support.

See [the dull^H^H^H^ full documentation](https://github.com/Mihara/RasterPropMonitor/wiki) in the wiki on GitHub.

This is a fork to begin work on RPM Plugins for various mods. Initial plans are to create pages for [Magic Smoke Industries - Infernal Robotics](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37707-0-23-Techtree-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Parts-Infernal-Robotics-0-12-%281-30-2014%29) - just some simple controls for operating parts while in IVA without that pesky floating UI.
